INTRODUCTION:
Welcome to the Photo Archive by Face Tagging project's Developer Guide! The goal of this manual is to give thorough documentation 
and instructions to developers who wish to use or contribute to this technology. The Photo Archive by Face
Tagging project aims to manage and organize a photo archive by facial recognition technology. Developers can efficiently
contribute to the project's development by comprehending the system's design and API usage with the help of this guide.

Overview
Purpose of the Project
The Photo Archive by Face Tagging project aims to streamline the process of managing a photo archive by automatically 
detecting and tagging faces in the images. This simplifies the organization and searchability of the photo collection, 
making it easier for users to find specific individuals or groups of people within their photos.

Key Features
Automatic face detection and tagging.
Manual tag refinement for increased accuracy.
Advanced search capabilities based on tagged faces.
Intuitive web interface for easy navigation.

System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture, where the front end interacts with the back-end server through a set of APIs. 
The back-end is responsible for face detection, tagging, and data storage, while the front-end provides the user interface for 
photo uploads, browsing, and searching.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
The following prerequisites:

Understanding of Python and web development.
Familiarity with RESTful APIs.
Basic knowledge of facial recognition algorithms.

Installation
To set up the development environment, follow these steps:
Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Install the required dependencies using pip.
Configure the database connection and API keys.
Configuration
The project's configuration is stored in a .env file, which should never be committed to version control. Ensure 
you provide the necessary environment variables for database access, API keys, and other sensitive information.

 Usage
Uploading Photos
Users can upload their photo collections through the web interface or by utilizing the provided API endpoints for bulk uploads.

Automatic Face Tagging
Once the photos are uploaded, the system automatically detects faces using advanced facial recognition algorithms and 
assigns initial tags based on the identified individuals.

Manual Tag Refinement
To improve tagging accuracy, users can manually refine the tags for each face. This process helps the system learn from user input and enhances future tagging accuracy.

Searching and Browsing Photos
The web interface allows users to search for specific individuals or browse photos based on tagged faces. The search functionality leverages the underlying tagging system to deliver relevant results.

API Reference
Authentication
All API endpoints require authentication using an API key, which should be included in the headers of each request.

Endpoints
/api/photos: Endpoint for uploading and managing photos.
/api/faces: Endpoint for retrieving and updating face tags.
/api/search: Endpoint for searching photos by tag.
Request and Response Formats
All API endpoints expect and return data in JSON format. Be sure to include the appropriate headers in your requests.

Contribution Guidelines
Reporting Issues
When reporting issues or bugs, use the issue tracker on the project's GitHub repository. Provide detailed steps to reproduce the problem and include relevant error logs.
